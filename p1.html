    <h3>
        DON’T WORRY.
    </h3>

    <p>Everything is under control.</p>

    <p>I know how you’re feeling. You wake up alone in a strange room, you get up, you look around, you soon discover that both doors are locked from the outside. It’s enough to unsettle anybody, especially when you try and try and try to recall how you got here and you just can’t do it.
    But beyond that … there’s this feeling. I know you’re feeling it right now. I know a lot of things—and I’ll reveal them all as we go along.</p>
    <p>One of the things I know it this:</p>
    If you will sit down, put this message back on the table where you found it, and take slow, deep breaths while counting to one hundred, you’ll feel a lot better.
    <p>I promise you will.</p>
    <p>Do that now.</p>
