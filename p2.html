    <p>See what I mean? You do feel a lot better.

        That feeling won’t last for long, I’m sorry to say.
        
        I wish there was an easier way to do this, but there isn’t, and believe me, many ways have been tried. So here we go:
        
        This is not 1986.
        
        You are not twenty-five years old.
        
        The date is
        
        <s>January February March April May</s> June
        
        <s>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</s>
        
        <s>2006 2007 2008</s>
        
        A lot of things have happened in
        
        <s>twenty</s>            <s>twenty-one</s>            <s>twenty-two</s>
        
        years, and I’ll tell you all you need to know about that in good time.
        
        For now … Don’t Worry.
        
        Slow, deep breaths. Close your eyes. Count to a hundred.
        
        You’ll feel better.
        
        I promise.
        
    </p>
