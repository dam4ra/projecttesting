            <p>That was refreshing, wasn’t it?</p>
            <p>It shouldn’t surprise you that all your favorite breakfast foods were on the table.</p>
            <p>You eat the same meal every morning, and never get tired of it.</p>
            <p>And I’m sorry if that statement took some of the pleasure out of the meal, but it is necessary for me to keep reminding you of your circumstances, to prevent a cycle of denial getting started.</p>
            <p>Here is the thing you must bear in mind.</p>
            <p>Today is the rest of your life.</p>
            <p>Because that life will be so short, it is essential that you waste none of it.</p>
            <p>In this letter I have sometimes stated the obvious, written out conclusions you have already reached—in a sense, wasted your time.</p>
            <p>Each time it was done—and each time it will yet be done in the rest of this letter—was for a purpose.</p>
            <p>Points must be driven home, sometimes brutally, sometimes repetitiously.</p>
            <p>I promise you this sort of thing will be kept to an absolute minimum.</p>
            <p>So here comes a few paragraphs that might be a waste of time, but really aren’t, as they dispose neatly of several thousand of the most burning questions in your mind.</p>
            <p>The questions can be summed up as “What has happened in twenty years?”</p>
            <p>The answer is: You don’t care.</p>
            <p>You can’t afford to care.</p>
            <p>Even a brief synopsis of recent events would take hours to read, and would be the sheerest foolishness.</p>
            <p>You don’t care who the President is.</p>
            <p>The price of gasoline doesn’t concern you, nor does the victor in the ’98 World Series.</p>
            <p>Why learn this trivia when you would only have to re-learn it tomorrow?</p>
            <p>You don’t care which books and movies are currently popular.</p>
            <p>You have read your last book, seen your last movie.</p>
            <p>Luckily, you are an orphan with no siblings or other close relatives.</p>
            <p>(It is lucky; think about it.)</p>
            <p>The girl you were going with at the time of your accident has forgotten all about you—and you don’t care, because you didn’t love her.</p>
            <p>There are things that have happened which you need to know about; I’ll speak of them very soon.</p>
            <p>In the meantime…</p>
            <p>How do you like the room?</p>
            <p>Not at all like a hospital, is it?</p>
            <p>Comfortable and pleasant—yet it has no windows, and the only other door was locked when you tried it.</p>
            <p>Try it again.</p>
            <p>It will open now.</p>
            <p>And remember…</p>
            <p>Don’t Worry.</p>
