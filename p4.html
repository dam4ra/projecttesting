        Really. Don't worry.
    </h3>

    <p>Well.

        I know how rough that was. I know you’re trembling. I know you’re feeling confusion, fear, anger … a thousand emotions.
        
        And I know you have a thousand questions. They will all be answered, every one of them, at the proper time.
        
        Here are some ground rules.
        
        I will never lie to you. You can’t imagine how much care and anguish has gone into the composition of this letter. For now, you must take my word that things will be revealed to you in the most useful order, and in the easiest way that can be devised. You must appreciate that not all your questions can be answered at once. It may be harder for you to accept that some questions cannot be answered at all until a proper background has been prepared. These answers would mean nothing to you at this point.
        
        You would like someone—anyone—to be with you right now, so you could ask these questions. That has been tried, and the results were needlessly chaotic and confusing. Trust me; this is the best way.
        
        Any why should you trust me? For a very good reason.
        
        I am you. 
        
        You wrote — in a manner of speaking — every word in this letter, to help yourself through this agonizing moment.
        
        Deep breaths, please.
        
        Stay seated; it helps a little.
        
        And Don’t Worry.
