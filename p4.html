            <p>Well.</p>
            <p>I know how rough that was.</p>
            <p>I know you’re trembling.</p>
            <p>I know you’re feeling confusion, fear, anger … a thousand emotions.</p>
            <p>And I know you have a thousand questions. They will all be answered, every one of them, at the proper time.</p>
            <p>Here are some ground rules.</p>
            <p>I will never lie to you.</p>
            <p>You can’t imagine how much care and anguish has gone into the composition of this letter.</p>
            <p>For now, you must take my word that things will be revealed to you in the most useful order, and in the easiest way that can be devised.</p>
            <p>You must appreciate that not all your questions can be answered at once.</p>
            <p>It may be harder for you to accept that some questions cannot be answered at all until a proper background has been prepared.</p>
            <p>These answers would mean nothing to you at this point.</p>
            <p>You would like someone—anyone—to be with you right now, so you could ask these questions.</p>
            <p>That has been tried, and the results were needlessly chaotic and confusing.</p>
            <p>Trust me; this is the best way.</p>
            <p>Any why should you trust me?</p>
            <p>For a very good reason.</p>
            <p>I am you.</p>
            <p>You wrote—in a manner of speaking—every word in this letter, to help yourself through this agonizing moment.</p>
            <p>Deep breaths, please.</p>
            <p>Stay seated; it helps a little.</p>
            <p>And <span class="glow">Don't Worry.</span></p>
