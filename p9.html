            <img class="story-image-header" src="images/apartment.jpg" />
            <p>So what does all this have to do with me, I hear you cry.</p>
            <p>Why couldn’t I have lived out my one day on Earth without worrying about this?</p>
            <p>Well … who do you think is paying for this fabulous apartment?</p>
            <p>The grateful taxpayers, that’s who. You didn’t think you’d get original Picassos on the walls if you were nothing more than a brain-damaged geek, did you?</p>
            <p>And why are the taxpayers grateful?</p>
            <p>Because anything that keeps the Martians happy, keeps the taxpayers happy. The Martians scare hell out of everyone … and you are their fair-haired boy.</p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>Because you don’t experience time like the rest of humanity does.</p>
            <p>You start fresh every day. You haven’t had fifteen years to think about the Martians, you haven’t developed any prejudice toward them or their way of thinking.</p>
            <p>Maybe.</p>
            <p>Most of that could be bullshit. We don’t know if prejudice has anything to do with it … but you do see time differently. The fact is, the best mathematicians and physicists in the world have tried to deal with the Martians, and the Martians aren’t interested. Every day they come to talk to you.</p>
            <p>Most days, nothing is accomplished. They spend an hour, then go wherever it is they go, in whatever manner they do it. One day out of hundred, you get an insight. Everything I’ve told you so far is the result of those insights being compiled—</p>
            <p>—along with the work of others. There are a few hundred of you, around the world. No other man or woman has your peculiar affliction; all are what most people would call mentally limited. There are the progressive amnesiacs I mentioned earlier. There are people with split-brain disorders, people with almost unbelievable perceptual aberrations, such as the woman who has lost the concept of “right.” Left is the only direction that exists in her brain.</p>
            <p>The Martians spend time with these people, people like you.</p>
            <p>So we tentatively conclude this about the Martians:</p>
            <p>They want to teach us something.</p>
            <p>It is painfully obvious they could have destroyed us any time they wished to do so. They have enslaved us, in the sense that we are pathetically eager to do anything we even suspect they might want us to do. But they don’t seem to want to do anything with us. They’ve made no move to breed us for meat animals or conscript us into labor camps.</p>
            <p>They have simply arrived, demonstrated their powers, and started talking to people like you.</p>
            <p>No one knows if we can learn what they are trying to teach us.</p> 
            <p>But it behooves us to try, wouldn’t you think?</p>
