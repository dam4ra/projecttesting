    <p>So now we’re past bombshell #2. There are more to come, but they will be easier to take, simply because your capacity to be surprised is just about at its peak right now. A certain numbness will set in. You should be thankful for that.
        And now, back to your questions.
        
        Top of the list: What happened?
        
        Briefly (and it must be brief—more on that later):
       
        In 1989 you had an accident. It involved a motorcycle which you don’t remember owning because you didn’t buy it until 1988, and a city bus. You had a difference of opinion concerning the right of way, and the bus won.
       
        Feel your scalp with your fingertips. Don’t be queasy; it healed long ago—as much as it’s going to. Under those great knots of scar tissue are the useless results of the labors of the best neurosurgeons in the country. In the end, they just had to scoop out a lot of grey matter and close you back up, shaking their heads sagely and opining that you would probably feel right at home under glass on a salad bar.
       
        But you fooled them. You woke up, and there was much rejoicing, even though you couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86. You were conscious a few hours, long enough for the doctors to determine that your intelligence didn’t seem to be impaired. You could talk, read, speak, see, hear. Then you went back to sleep.
        
        The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86. No one was too worried. They told you again what had happened. You were awake most of the day, and again you fell asleep.
        
        The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86. Some consternation was expressed.
       
        The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86. Professorial heads were scratched, seven-syllable Latin words intoned, and deep mumbles were mumbled.
       
        The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86.
        
        And the next day
       
        And the next day
        
        And the day after that.
        
        This morning you woke up and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86, and I know this is getting old, but I had to make the point in this way, because it is
       
        <s>2006</s>            <s>2007</s>            <s>2008</s>
        
        and we’ve begun to think a pattern is established.
        
        No, no, don’t breathe deeply, don’t count to one hundred, face this one head on. It’ll be good for you.
        
        Back under control?
        
        I knew you could do it.
        
        What you have is called Progressive Narco-Catalepti-Amnesiac Syndrome (PNCAS, or Pinkus in conversation), and you should be proud of yourself, because they made up the term to describe your condition and at least a half-dozen papers have been written proving it can’t happen. What seems to happen, in spite of the papers, is that you store and retrieve memories just fine as long as you have a continuous thread of consciousness. But the sleep center somehow activates an erase mechanism in your head, so that all you experienced during the day is lost to you when you wake up again. The old memories are intact and vivid; the new ones are ephemeral, like they were recorded on a continuous tape loop.
        
        Most amnesias of this type behave rather differently. Retrograde amnesia is seen fairly frequently, whereby you gradually lose even the old memories and become as an infant. And progressive amnesias are not unknown, but those poor people can’t remember what happened to them as little as five minutes ago. Try to imagine what life would be like in those circumstances before you start crying in your beer.
        
        Yeah, great, I hear you whine. And what’s so great about this?
        
        Well, nothing, at first glance. I’ll certainly be the last one to argue about that. My own re-awakening is too fresh in my mind, having happened only fifteen hours ago. And, in a sense, I will soon be dead, snatched back from this mayfly existence by the greedy arms of Morpheus. When I sleep tonight, most of what I feel makes me mewill vanish. I will awake, an older and less wise man, to confusion, will read this letter, will breathe deeply, count to one hundred, stare into the mirror at a stranger. I will be you.
        
        And yet, now, as I scan rapidly through this letter for the second time today (I said I wrote it, but only in a sense; it was written by a thousand mayflies), they are asking me if there is anything I wish to change. If I want a change, Marian will see that it is made. Is there anything I would like to do differently tomorrow? Is there something I want to tell you, my successor in this body, to beware of, to disbelieve? Are there any warnings I would issue?
        
        The answer is no.
       
        I will let this letter stand, in its entirety.
       
        There are things still for you to learn that will convince you, against all common sense, that you have a wonderful life/day ahead of you.
       
        But you need a rest. You need time to think.
       
        Do this for me. Go back to the date. Mark out the last number and write in the next. If it’s a new month, change that, too.
        
        Now you will find the other door will open. Please go into the next room, where you will find breakfast, and an envelope containing the next part of this letter.
        
        Don’t open it yet. Eat your breakfast.
        
        Think it over.
        
        But don’t take too long. Your time is short, and you won’t want to waste it.
