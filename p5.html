            <p>So now we’re past bombshell #2.</p>
            <p>There are more to come, but they will be easier to take, simply because your capacity to be surprised is just about at its peak right now.</p>
            <p>A certain numbness will set in.</p>
            <p>You should be thankful for that.</p>
            <p>And now, back to your questions.</p>
            <p>Top of the list: What happened?</p>
            <p>Briefly (and it must be brief—more on that later):</p>
            <p>In 1989 you had an accident.</p>
            <p>It involved a motorcycle which you don’t remember owning because you didn’t buy it until 1988, and a city bus.</p>
            <p>You had a difference of opinion concerning the right of way, and the bus won.</p>
            <p>Feel your scalp with your fingertips.</p>
            <p>Don’t be queasy; it healed long ago—as much as it’s going to.</p>
            <p>Under those great knots of scar tissue are the useless results of the labors of the best neurosurgeons in the country.</p>
            <p>In the end, they just had to scoop out a lot of grey matter and close you back up, shaking their heads sagely and opining that you would probably feel right at home under glass on a salad bar.</p>
            <p>But you fooled them.</p>
            <p>You woke up, and there was much rejoicing, even though you couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86.</p>
            <p>You were conscious a few hours, long enough for the doctors to determine that your intelligence didn’t seem to be impaired.</p>
            <p>You could talk, read, speak, see, hear.</p>
            <p>Then you went back to sleep.</p>
            <p>The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86.</p>
            <p>No one was too worried.</p>
            <p>They told you again what had happened.</p>
            <p>You were awake most of the day, and again you fell asleep.</p>
            <p>The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86.</p>
            <p>Some consternation was expressed.</p>
            <p>The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86.</p>
            <p>Professorial heads were scratched, seven-syllable Latin words intoned, and deep mumbles were mumbled.</p>
            <p>The next day you woke up, and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86.</p>
            <p>And the next day</p>
            <p>And the next day</p>
            <p>And the day after that.</p>
            <p>This morning you woke up and couldn’t remember anything after the summer of ’86, and I know this is getting old, but I had to make the point in this way, because it is</p>
            <p><s>2006 2007 2008</s></p>
            <p>and we’ve begun to think a pattern is established.</p>
            <p>No, no, don’t breathe deeply, don’t count to one hundred, face this one head on.</p>
            <p>It’ll be good for you.</p>
            <p>Back under control?</p>
            <p>I knew you could do it.</p>
            <p>What you have is called Progressive Narco-Catalepti-Amnesiac Syndrome (PNCAS, or Pinkus in conversation), and you should be proud of yourself, because they made up the term to describe your condition and at least a half-dozen papers have been written proving it can’t happen.</p>
            <p>What seems to happen, in spite of the papers, is that you store and retrieve memories just fine as long as you have a continuous thread of consciousness.</p>
            <p>But the sleep center somehow activates an erase mechanism in your head, so that all you experienced during the day is lost to you when you wake up again.</p>
            <p>The old memories are intact and vivid; the new ones are ephemeral, like they were recorded on a continuous tape loop.</p>
            <p>Most amnesias of this type behave rather differently.</p>
            <p>Retrograde amnesia is seen fairly frequently, whereby you gradually lose even the old memories and become as an infant.</p>
            <p>And progressive amnesias are not unknown, but those poor people can’t remember what happened to them as little as five minutes ago.</p>
            <p>Try to imagine what life would be like in those circumstances before you start crying in your beer.</p>
            <p>Yeah, great, I hear you whine.</p>
            <p>And what’s so great about this?</p>
            <p>Well, nothing, at first glance.</p>
            <p>I’ll certainly be the last one to argue about that.</p>
            <p>My own re-awakening is too fresh in my mind, having happened only fifteen hours ago.</p>
            <p>And, in a sense, I will soon be dead, snatched back from this mayfly existence by the greedy arms of Morpheus.</p>
            <p>When I sleep tonight, most of what I feel makes me me will vanish.</p>
            <p>I will awake, an older and less wise man, to confusion, will read this letter, will breathe deeply, count to one hundred, stare into the mirror at a stranger.</p>
            <p>I will be you.</p>
            <p>And yet, now, as I scan rapidly through this letter for the second time today (I said I wrote it, but only in a sense; it was written by a thousand mayflies), they are asking me if there is anything I wish to change.</p>
            <p>If I want a change, Marian will see that it is made.</p>
            <p>Is there anything I would like to do differently tomorrow?</p>
            <p>Is there something I want to tell you, my successor in this body, to beware of, to disbelieve?</p>
            <p>Are there any warnings I would issue?</p>
            <p>The answer is no.</p>
            <p>I will let this letter stand, in its entirety.</p>
            <p>There are things still for you to learn that will convince you, against all common sense, that you have a wonderful life/day ahead of you.</p>
            <p>But you need a rest.</p>
            <p>You need time to think.</p>
            <p>Do this for me.</p>
            <p>Go back to the date.</p>
            <p>Mark out the last number and write in the next.</p>
            <p>If it’s a new month, change that, too.</p>
            <p>Now you will find the other door will open.</p>
            <p>Please go into the next room, where you will find breakfast, and an envelope containing the next part of this letter.</p>
            <p>Don’t open it yet.</p>
            <p>Eat your breakfast.</p>
            <p>Think it over.</p>
            <p>But don’t take too long.</p>
            <p>Your time is short, and you won’t want to waste it.</p>
