            <p>All right.</p> 
            <p>You just had to prove you could do things your own way, didn’t you?</p>
            <p>I don’t care that you brought the letter with you, but your having done so provides one last bit of proof that I know you pretty well, doesn’t it?</p>
            <p>Now, back to the bloody Martians.</p> 
            <p>It’s amazing how on-target Steven Spielberg was, isn’t it?</p>
            <p>That way that ship floats out there … and it’s bigger than the mother ship in Close Encounters. That sucker is over thirty miles across. At its lowest point it is two miles in the air. The upper parts reach into space. It has floated out there for fifteen years and not budged one inch. People call it The Saucer. There are fifteen others just like it, hovering near other major cities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And you think you have detected a flaw, don’t you?</p>
            <p>How would you have seen it, you ask, if it had been a cloudy day?</p> 
            <p>If it had been just a normal New York smoggy day, for that matter. </p>
            <p>Then you’d be reading this, scratching your head, wondering what the hell I’m talking about. The answer will illustrate everyone’s concern. 
            <p>There are no more cloudy days in New York.</p>
            <p>The Martians don’t seem to like rain, so they don’t let it happen here. As for the smog … they told us to stop it, and we did. Wouldn’t you, with that thing floating out there?</p>
            <p>About the name, Martians… We first detected their ships in the neighborhood of Mars. I know you’d have found it easier to swallow, in a perverse way, had I told you they came from Alpha Centauri or the Andromeda Galaxy or the planet Tralfamadore. But people got to calling them Martians because that’s what they were called on television. We don’t think they’re really from Mars. We don’t know where they’re from, but it’s probably not from around here. And by that, I mean not just another galaxy, but another universe. We think our own universe exists sort of as a shadow to them.</p>
            <p>This will be hard to explain. Take it slowly.</p>
            <p>Do you remember Flatland, and Mr. A Square? He lived in a two-dimensional universe. There was no up or down, just right and left, forward and backward. He could not conceive the notion of up or down. Mr. Square was visited by a three-dimensional being, a sphere, who drifted down through the world of Flatland. Square perceived the sphere as a circle that gradually grew, and then shrank. All he could see at any one moment was a cross-section of the sphere, while the sphere, god-like, could look down into Mr. Square’s world, even touch inside Square’s body without going through the skin.</p>
            <p>It was all just an interesting intellectual exercise, until the Martians arrived. Now we think they’re like the sphere, and we are Mr. Square. They live in another dimension, and they don’t perceive time and space like we do.</p>
            <p>An example: You saw they appeared humanoid. We don’t think they really are. We think they simply allow us to see a portion of their bodies which they project into our three-dimensional world and cause to appear humanoid. Their real shape must be vastly complex.</p>
            <p>Consider your hand. If you thrust your fingers into Flatland Mr. Square would see four circles and not imagine them to be connected. Putting your hand in further, he would see the circles merge into an oblong. Or an even better analogy is the shadow-play. By suitably entwining your two hands in front of a light, you can cast a shadow on a wall that resembles a bird, or a bull, or an elephant, or even a man. What we see of the Martians is no more real than a Kermit the Frog hand puppet. The ship is the same way. We see merely a three-dimensional cross-section of a much larger and more complex structure. At least we think so.</p>
            <p>Communication with the Martians is very frustrating, nearly impossible. They are so foreign to us. They never tell us anything that makes sense, never say the same thing twice. We assume it would make sense if we could think the way they do. And it is important.</p>
            <p>They are very powerful. Weather control is just a parlor trick. When they invaded, they invaded all at once—and I hope I can explain this to you, as I’m far from sure I understand it myself, after a full day with Martians. They invaded fifteen years ago … but they also invaded in 1854, and in 1520, and several other times in the “past.” The past seems to be merely another direction to them, like up or down. You’ll be shown books, old books, with woodcuts and drawings and contemporary accounts of how the Martians arrived, what they did, when they left … and don’t be concerned that you don’t remember these momentous events from your high school history class, because no one else does, either.</p>
            <p>Do you begin to understand? It seems that, from the moment they arrived here, in the late part of the twentieth century, they changed the past so that they had already arrived several times before. We have the history books to prove that they did. The fact that no one remembers these stories being in the history books before they arrived this time must be seen as an object lesson. One assumes they could have changed our memories of events as easily as the events themselves. That they did not do so means they meant us to be impressed. Had they changed both the events and our memories of them, no one would be the wiser; we would all assume history had always been that way, because that’s the way we remembered it.</p>
            <p>The whole idea of history books must be a tremendous joke to them, since they don’t experience time consecutively. Had enough? There’s more.</p>
            <p>They can do more than add things to our history. They can take things away. Things like the World Trade Center. That’s right, go look for it. It’s not out there, and we didn’t tear it down. It never existed in this world, except in our memories. It’s like a big, shared illusion.</p>
            <p>Other things have turned up missing as well. Things like Knoxville, Tennessee, Lake Huron, the Presidency of William McKinley, the Presbyterian Church, the rhinoceros (including the fossil record of its ancestors), Jack the Ripper (and all the literary works written about him), the letter Q, and Ecuador. Presbyterians still remember their faith and have built new churches to replace the ones that were never built. Who needed the goddamn rhino, anyway? Another man served McKinley’s term (and was also assassinated). Seeing book after book where “kw” replaces “q” is only amusing—and very kweer. But the people of Knoxville—and a dozen other towns around the world—never existed. They are still trying to sort out the real estate around where Lake Huron used to be. And you can search the world’s atlases in vain for any sight of Ecuador.</p>
            <p>The best wisdom is that the Martians could do even more, if they wanted to. Such as wiping out the element oxygen, the charge on the electron, or, of course, the planet Earth.</p>
            <p>They invaded, and they won quite easily.</p>
            <p>And their weapon is very much like an editor’s blue pencil.</p> 
            <p>Rather than <i>destroy</i> our world, they <i>re-write</i> it.</p>
