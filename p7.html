        <div class="story-container">
            
            <p><span class="glow">Don't Worry.</span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="glow">Don't Worry.</span></p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="glow"><strong>Don't Worry.</strong></span></p>
            <br>
            <p>You will have stopped crying by now.</p>
            <p>I know you desperately need someone to talk to, a human face to look into.</p>
            <p>You will have that very soon now, but for another few minutes I still must reach out to you from your recent past.</p>
            <p>Incidentally, the reason the breathing exercises and the counting are so effective is a post-hypnotic suggestion left in your mind.</p>
            <p>When you see the words <span class="glow">Don't Worry</span>, it relaxes you.</p>
            <p>It seems that some part of your mind retains shadows of memory that you can’t reach—which may also account for why you believe all this apparent rubbish.</p>
            <p>Are the tears dry?</p>
            <p>It did the same thing to me.</p>
            <p>Even seeing my own face aged in the mirror didn’t affect me like seeing the view from my windows.</p>
            <p>Then it became real.</p>
            <p>You are on one of the top floors of the Chrysler Building.</p>
            <p>Your view to the north included many, many buildings that were not there in 1986, and jumbled among them were many familiar buildings, distinctive as fingerprints.</p>
            <p>This is New York, and it is a new century, and that view is impossible to deny and as real as a fist.</p>
            <p>That’s why you wept.</p>
            <p>Not too many more bombshells to go now.</p>
            <p>But the next one is a doozy.</p>
            <p>Let’s creep up on it, shall we?</p>
            <p>You’ve already looked at the three photographs on the table beside your breakfast.</p>
            <p>Consider them now, in order.</p>
            <p>The big, bluff, hearty-looking fellow is Ian MacIntyre, who you’ll meet in a few minutes.</p>
            <p>He will be your counselor/companion today, and he is the head of a very important project in which you are involved.</p>
            <p>It’s impossible not to like him, though you, like me, will try to resist at first.</p>
            <p>But he is too wise push it, and you’ve always liked people, anyway.</p>
            <p>Besides, he has a lot of experience in winning your friendship, having done so every day for eight years.</p>
            <p>On to the second picture.</p>
            <p>Looks almost human, doesn’t he?</p>
            <p>If the offspring of Gumby and E.T. could be considered human.</p>
            <p>He is humanoid: two eyes, nose, mouth, two arms and two legs, and that goofy grin.</p>
            <p>The green skin you’ll get used to quickly enough.</p>
            <p>What he is, is a Martian.</p>
            <p>See, fifteen years ago the Martians landed and took over the planet Earth.</p>
            <p>We still don’t know what they plan to do with it, but some of the theories are not good news for Homo sapiens.</p>
            <p><span class="glow">Don't Worry.</span></p>
            <p>Take a few deep breaths.</p>
            <p>I’ll wait.</p>
