            <p>Again, you say: Why me?</p>
            <p>Or even more to the point: Why should I care?</p>
            <p>I know your bitterness, and I understand it. Why should you spend even an hour of your precious time on problems you don’t really care about, when it would be much easier and more satisfying spending your sixteen hours of awareness gnawing on yourself, wallowing in self-pity, and in general being a one-man soap-opera.</p>
            <p>But you were never that kind of person. You’ve just about exhausted your store of self-pity during the process of reading this letter. If you have only one day—though it hurts like hell … so be it! You will spend that day doing something useful.</p>
            <p>I envy you, you skeptical bastard.</p>
            <p>We could wish things were different. It is not fair that we have only one day. I, who am at the end of it, can feel the pain you only sense. I have my wonderful memories … which will soon be gone.</p>
            <p>But I swear to you, I feel like an old, old man who has lived a full life, who has no regrets for anything he ever did, who accomplished something in his life, who loved, and was loved in return.</p>
            <p>Can many “normal” people die saying that?</p>
            <p>In just a few seconds that one, last locked door will open, and your new life will come through it. I guarantee it will be interesting.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I love you, and I now leave you …</p>
            <br>
            <p>Have a nice day.</p>
